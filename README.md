# MGJars

## Overview
The role of this R package is to inialize a JVM and distribute
necessary jar files for interacting with the TASSEL and PHG APIs. This is
used in two packages generated by the Buckler Lab: `rTASSEL` and `rPHG`.

This is currently in a semi-workable stage with the `*/feature/no-jars`
experimental branches of `rTASSEL` and `rPHG`. In order to use this, the
user will need to manually initialize:

```
library(BLJars)
```

...and then load `rTASSEL` and/or `rPHG`:

```
library(rTASSEL)
library(rPHG)
```
